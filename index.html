          <h2>Hello.</h2>
          <p>My name is Nathan Orecchio, but you can call me Nate, and this website is divoted to my progress as a web developer.
             I have put some of my skills on here and some other blurbs about myself, so please have a look around and learn more about me and my progress as a web developer.

            <h3>HTML</h3>
            <p>I starting learning HTML because I wanted to make a website for my friend's manga. So, I picked up a book at Barnes & Noble and I got through it in a couple of days. Now I'm taking a web development class on Udemy and I feel very comfortable with HTML. I wouldn't say I'm an expert, but, overall, I would rate my skils a 3.5 out of 5.</p>

            <h3>Volley Ball</h3>
            <p>This is a bit of a silly example, but this is not a serious website, so why not have fun with it?! By trade, I am a soccer player. I love the sport (Go Man City!), and I have been playing it all my life. Recently, I've been going with my dad to Pinheads to play pick-up beach volleyball. I've really enjoyed it and I'm not half bad. My dad also coaches volleyball so he has been giving me some tips and tricks to help me improve my game. I would say that my volleyball skills are a solid 3 out of 5.</p>
